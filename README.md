> [!IMPORTANT]
> **What's New in This Fork** — this is the **vampiiluk/shop** fork of Frappe
> Shop. It ships everything from upstream **plus** a fraud-protection and
> delivery-risk suite, on top of the stock storefront. Install it from the
> `develop` branch:
>
> ```bash
> bench get-app shop https://github.com/vampiiluk/shop --branch develop
> ```
>
> ### Fraud protection & identity
>
> - **Device fingerprint at checkout:** shoppers are fingerprinted with
>   FingerprintJS v5 when they place an order — no account required.
> - **Hybrid identification:** checkout is hardened with the Fingerprint
>   Identification API and Smart Signal extraction from every event.
> - **Fraud Intelligence UI:** Overview and per-order Detail pages with a
>   snapshot-vs-live split, customer live checks, and one-click recalculation.
>
> ### Address verification pipeline
>
> - **Single record per address:** one verification record per street address +
>   landmark combination — no more duplicate lookups for the same doorstep.
> - **Queue-first model:** nothing scans or geocodes at checkout. A scheduler
>   (every 10 / 20 minutes or hourly — configurable) drains a work queue, and a
>   re-verify action re-queues any record.
> - **Merged risk score:** openrouteservice geocoding and Google Maps results are
>   combined into a /80 risk score, mirrored to the Address and every linked
>   Sales Order.
> - **Landmark intelligence:** a landmark dataset pipeline feeds cached geocoding
>   so fraud scoring never re-pays for the same coordinates.
>
> ### AI risk analysis
>
> - **Deep per-order analysis:** each order gets a Gemini-powered risk assessment
>   scored across five domains — address consistency, device trust, behavioral,
>   geographic, and payment.
> - **Domain breakdown in the UI:** the five sub-scores render as labeled bars on
>   the Fraud Detail page and the order's Fraud panel.
> - **Manual, on-demand run:** AI analysis is deliberately manual to conserve AI
>   usage — run it from the Fraud page whenever you need it.
>
> ### Configurable rules
>
> - **Editable fraud weights:** tune every signal weight from Shop Settings.
> - **City RTO thresholds:** per-city return-to-origin rates drive geographic
>   risk.
> - **Provinces & multi-country addresses:** editable province lists and generic
>   international address support.
> - **Queue scheduling:** set how often the verification queue drains.
>
> ### Security notes
>
> - Sensitive fields (API keys, AI keys) are shown as stored secrets with a purge
>   option, and are never echoed back to the client.
> - Checkout collects the fingerprint once per order attempt, so you are not
>   billed for repeated Identify calls.

> [!WARNING]
> Frappe Shop is under active development and is **not production ready**.
> Doctypes, APIs and theme internals are still changing without migrations, so
> treat it as a preview: try it on a fresh site, not on a store you sell from.

## Frappe Shop

Frappe Shop is B2C e-commerce for the Frappe stack. The shopper facing
storefront is rendered entirely by [Frappe Builder](https://github.com/frappe/builder)
pages, so every page is a canvas a merchant can restyle visually rather than a
template only a developer can touch. Orders, items, pricing, stock and customers
are plain ERPNext documents, and a [Frappe UI](https://github.com/frappe/frappe-ui)
admin at `/shop` runs the store day to day.

### Key Features

- **Visual storefront:** Home, listing, product, cart, checkout, order and
  account pages are Builder pages. Drag the shipped components onto a canvas to
  rebuild any of them, or design new ones.
- **Themes:** Ship as Builder template groups and switch in one click from
  Settings. Merchant edits survive a switch, so you can try a theme and go back.
- **Guest checkout:** Carts are keyed by an httponly cookie, so shoppers buy
  without an account and can still track the order from a signed link.
- **Payments:** Cash on delivery works with zero configuration. Connect any
  gateway supported by the [payments](https://github.com/frappe/payments) app
  for online payment.
- **Returns and replacements:** Customers raise a request from their own order
  page inside the return window; merchants approve, reject or complete it from a
  queue, with a note the customer sees.
- **Fulfillment:** Ship it yourself with a delivery note and tracking, or plug
  in a provider through the fulfillment hook.
- **Merchant admin:** Dashboard, orders, fulfillments, returns, products and
  variants, inventory, collections, customers, reviews, discounts and carts.
- **ERPNext native:** Products are a publish layer over Item, variants are item
  variants, prices are Item Prices and stock is Bin. Nothing is duplicated, so
  the rest of ERPNext keeps working.

### Under the Hood

- [Frappe Framework](https://github.com/frappe/frappe): full stack web framework.
- [Frappe Builder](https://github.com/frappe/builder): renders the storefront.
- [ERPNext](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext): orders, stock, pricing, customers.
- [Frappe UI](https://github.com/frappe/frappe-ui): the merchant admin.

## Getting Started

### Local Setup

1. [Set up Bench](https://docs.frappe.io/framework/user/en/installation).
1. In the frappe-bench directory, run `bench start` and keep it running.
1. Open a new terminal, cd into `frappe-bench` and run:

```bash
bench get-app erpnext
bench get-app payments
bench get-app builder
bench get-app shop

bench new-site shop.localhost \
    --install-app erpnext --install-app payments --install-app builder --install-app shop
bench set-config --global server_script_enabled 1
bench --site shop.localhost add-to-hosts
bench browse shop.localhost --user Administrator
```

`server_script_enabled` is required: storefront pages read their data through
Frappe's `safe_exec`. It has to be set bench-wide with `--global`; `safe_exec`
only reads `common_site_config.json`, so setting it on the site alone has no
effect.

A default theme is applied automatically on install, so the storefront is
live at `http://shop.localhost:8000` right away. Open
`http://shop.localhost:8000/shop` to finish onboarding and set up the store,
sample products and payments.

### Development

```bash
bench --site shop.localhost execute shop.demo.setup      # sample catalog
bench --site shop.localhost execute shop.demo.teardown   # remove it
bench --site shop.localhost run-tests --app shop         # server tests
cd apps/shop/e2e && npx playwright test                  # storefront and admin E2E
bench --site shop.localhost set-config ignore_csrf 1     # required for the admin dev server
cd apps/shop && yarn dev                                 # admin dev server
```

`ignore_csrf` is required because the Vite dev server proxies API calls from its
own port, which the CSRF check otherwise rejects as a different origin.

The walkthroughs at `/shop/walkthroughs` seed the exact state for a persona,
guest shopper through to operations manager, and hand you the steps to try that
flow end to end.
